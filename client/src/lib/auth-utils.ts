File: client/src/lib/auth-utils.ts

Module: Authentication and Access Control

Purpose:
Defines responsibilities specific to this unit while preserving
clear boundaries with adjacent modules in CampusCompanion.

Architectural Layer:
Application Layer (Business and Interaction Logic)

System Interaction:
- Consumes API endpoints via query/mutation utilities and renders user-facing interfaces
- Collaborates with shared types to preserve frontend-backend contract integrity

Design Rationale:
A dedicated file-level boundary supports maintainability,
traceability, and scalability by keeping concerns local and
allowing safe evolution of features without cross-module side effects.

Function: isUnauthorizedError

Purpose:
Encapsulates a discrete unit of logic to keep behavior reusable, testable, and easy to reason about.

Parameters:
- error: Input consumed by this routine during execution

Process:
1. Accepts and normalizes inputs before core processing
2. Applies relevant guards/validation to prevent invalid transitions
3. Executes primary logic path and handles expected edge conditions
4. Returns a deterministic output for the caller layer

Why Validation is Important:
Input and boundary checks protect data integrity, reduce fault propagation, and enforce predictable system behavior.

Returns:
A value/promise representing the outcome of the executed logic path.
